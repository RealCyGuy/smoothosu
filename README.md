# smoothosu

> Make your osu! cursor trails smooth! 

You can see an example of it in-game here: https://youtu.be/b-JEryD5d3s

## Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), and a terminal!

## Installation

Just run:

```shell
npm i -g smoothosu
```

## Usage

> It is recommended to duplicate your skin's folder so your skin won't be destroyed if something goes wrong and you will keep your original skin.

Change the working directory to the skin you want to make smooth. This folder can be found by clicking `Open current skin folder` in the settings. To change to the directory use this command a terminal replacing `/path/to/skin/folder` with... the path to your skin's folder.

```shell
cd /path/to/skin/folder
```

Then run the command.

```shell
smoothosu
```

When the confirmation appears, enter `y` if you want to continue.

```shell
prompt: Do you want to continue? [y]es/[n]o:  y
```

In osu, press `ctrl + shift + alt + s` to refresh your skin if neccesary. Then, set your cursor size to 2x (optional, but it's the default cursor size) and now you have a smooth cursor!
