# smoothosu

> Make your osu cursors smooth!

## Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), and a terminal!

## Installation

Just run:

```shell
npm i -g smoothosu
```

## Usage

After duplicating a osu skin folder, change the working directory to it.

```shell
cd /path/to/skin/folder
```

Then run the command.

```shell
smoothosu
```

When the confirmation appears, enter `y` if you want to continue.

```shell
prompt: Do you want to continue? [y]es/[n]o:  y
```

In osu, set your cursor size to 2x and now you have a smooth cursor!
